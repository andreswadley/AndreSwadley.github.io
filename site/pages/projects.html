<ul>
Intention can not be held in the mind//
</ul>

A glimpse of triumph, two objects continue their relations with unnecessary pain//

Constance threatens a bird with a garden axe//

In the distance Peter brandishes a knife that sits in conceited silver self-realization//
<ol>
Neither familiar with emotional cause//
</ol>
<dl>
     The objects alongside contain no intention//
  
          They do not care about repercussions at all//  
</dl>
