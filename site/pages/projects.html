<ul>
Intention can not be held in the mind//
</ul>

In an effort to gain superiority these two objects only end up hurting the thing they claim to be helping//

Unsatisfied with its position the garden axe further tries leveraging itself over the bird//

In the midst of making claims about its use the knife abuses its power to wound//
<ol>
The objects have no emotional objectives associated and therefore do not have intention//
</ol>
<dl>
The objects have no intention therefore they do not care about repercussions//
